# Account profile

The *Profile* page enables you to manage your account details and preferences. It is accessible by clicking on your profile picture, on the top right hand corner of the interface, and **Profile**. There are 3 tabs available in the *Profile* interface: *General*, *Preferences* and *Billing*. 

## General

The *General* tab enables you to edit the following details for your account profile:

- Details: to see the name associated with your account, which is based on the one defined in your GitHub account.
- Delete account: to permanently delete your Strapi Cloud account (see [Deleting Strapi Cloud account](#deleting-strapi-cloud-account)).
